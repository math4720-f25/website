Perform a thorough exploratory data analysis.\nAnalysis:\n\nExplain the chosen model/method.\nShow why the chosen model(s) is appropriate and better than others.\nAnswer your research questions by the analysis result.\n\nConclusion: Restate your research question, and summarize how you learn from data to answer your questions. What is the contribution of this project? Discuss any limitation of your model/method, and how it could be improved for better inference or prediction results.\nReferences/Bibliography: Include a detailed list of references, including papers, books, websites, code, and any idea/work that is not produced by yourself.\n\nIf you choose to do ML, your paper should include the following sections:\n\nIntroduction: State why you choose to learn this new method. Provide an overview and little history of the method. Describe the intuition and idea of the method. What are the pros and cons of the method?\nModel/Method: Provide the mathematical expression of the model. Explain the model and its properties, and how we do the supervised or unsupervised learning with the model.\nSimulation: Do a simulation study, and compare the chosen method with other methods learned in class. Determine which method performs better under what conditions.\nDiscussion: Based on the simulation results, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen method. Discuss any variants of the chosen method.\nReferences/Bibliography: Include a detailed list of references, including papers, books, websites, code, and any idea/work that is not produced by yourself.\n\n\n\nFormat and Layout\n\nYour project paper is saved as one PDF.\nYour paper should have your project title and your name on the first page. Date, Abstract, Keywords are optional.\nExcept the first title page, the margins should be no larger than one inch.\nExcept the project title and section title, the font size is 12 pt.\nPlease use 1.5 or double line spacing.\nYour report, including everything, should be at least 12 pages long, but no more than 15 pages.\nYour code should NOT be printed in the paper.\n\n\n\nCode\n\nYour code should be able to reproduce all the numerical results, outputs, tables, and figures shown in the report, including the source of the raw data (where you find and load the data) if the project is about data analysis."

For example, one-way ANOVA is a BAD model.\n\nCorrectness, Completeness and Complexity:\n\nAre machine learning methods carried out and explained correctly?\nDoes project include rigorous analysis and models? Simple linear regression model lacks complexity.\n\nWriting: What is the quality of the machine learning model/method presentation, visualization, writing, and explanations.\nFormat: Does the report follow the required format?\nCreativity and Critical Thought: Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?\nReproducibility: Can your code reproduce what you show in the paper?\nReference: Do you cite others work properly?"
