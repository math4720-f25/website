- **Assessments > Grades**



## Grading Policy &#x2728;

- Your final grade is earned out of **1000 total points** distributed as follows:
  - **Homework 1 to 8: 200 pts (25 pts each)**
  - **Quiz 1 to 4: 240 pts (60 pts each)**
  - **Exam 1 and 2: 320 pts (160 pts each)**
  - **Final exam: 240 pts**
  - **Class participation** for extra points!

- `r emo::ji("x")` No extra credit projects/homework/exam to compensate for a poor grade.
- Individual grade will **NOT** be curved.
- This is not a course that gives most of students grade A. Wanna get a good grade? Study hard. No pain, no gain! &#x270D; &#x270D;


## Grade-Percentage Conversion &#x2728;

- Your final grade is based on your percentage of points earned out of 1000 points.
- $[x, y)$ means greater than or equal to $x$ and less than $y$.

```{r}
#| echo: false
letter <- c("A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-",
                       "D+", "D", "F")
percentage <- c("[94, 100]", "[90, 94)", "[87, 90)", "[83, 87)", "[80, 83)",
                "[77, 80)", "[73, 77)", "[70, 73)",
                "[65, 70)", "[60, 65)", "[0, 60)")
grade_dist <- data.frame(Grade = letter, Percentage = percentage)
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(grade_dist, longtable = TRUE, format = "html", align = 'l') %>% kable_styling(position = "center", font_size = 21)
